# [FS-PINNs for Biot's Model: A combination of physics-informed neural networks with the fixed-stress splitting iteration for solving Biot's model]


This paper presents a new approach to solving Biot's consolidation model by combining Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the fixed-stress splitting method.
